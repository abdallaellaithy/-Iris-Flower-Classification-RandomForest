# Iris Species Classification with Random Forest

This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to classify Iris species using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. We utilize the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to train a classification model based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Key Components

- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the code.
- `iris.csv`: The Iris dataset used for training and testing the model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/abdallaellaithy/iris-classification.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd iris-classification```
3. Install dependencies:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

1. Open `iris_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell.
3. Explore the data, train the Random Forest classifier, and evaluate its performance.
4. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different parameters to improve the model.
